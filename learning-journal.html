                        When it comes to formal education. I don't enjoy it. Not atleast the 
                        education that i had to go through in my country. While i had no idea
                        about what i'm studying and why in school and college(no definite purpose).
                        In writing i found my hope and a direction.

                        I began exploring my options in this digital age. Soon the picture that
                        looked dark began to look brigh. And i made a commitment not to give up until i succeed. I burned my boats (to put things in perspective).</p>
